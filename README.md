# Applied Anti-SOLID and SOLID Principles
### Code Samples and UML Class Diagrams
-----------
#### S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) <br />
A class should have only a single responsibility.<br /><br />

------

#### O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP) <br />
A class should be open for extension but closed for modification. <br /><br />

-----

#### L - Liskov’s Substitution Principle (LSP) <br />
A type must be substitutable by its subtypes without altering the correctness of the application. <br /><br />

----

#### I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) <br />
Clients of a class should not be forced to depend on those of its methods that they don’t use.<br /><br />
![isp](https://github.com/BilgesPage/SOLID-Principles/blob/master/SOLID_Principles/Interface_Segregation/isp.JPG?raw=true "Interface Segregation Principle")

-----

#### D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)<br />
High-level classes should not dependent on low-level classes. Both of them should depend on abstractions.<br />
Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon
abstractions.<br />

--------

### SOLID Short Control List
- Do methods in the class have similar responsibilities? (SRP)
- Are there any method in the class that functions different based on different variables? (OCP)
- Are there any functionless methods/properties which comes from base class/interface in your derived classes? (LSP & ISP)
- Are there initiations of non-abstract objects in a high-level class? (DIP)
